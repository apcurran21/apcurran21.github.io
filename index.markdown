Hi, I'm Andy! I study computer science at Northwestern University, pursuing a combined BS/MS degree (expected June 2025).

I'm broadly interested in computing for biologically-inspired problems. I currently work on research projects modeling coral bleaching at the [Marcelino Lab](http://www.civil.northwestern.edu/EHE/Marcelinogroup/index.html) and investigating mantis shrimp visual systems at the [BIV Lab](https://www.alexander.vision/).

I also enjoy learning about robotics and quantum computing - I hold leadership roles in campus organizations such as the NU Robotics' UROV (Underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle) subteam and Quantum Game Club.
